            <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>, commonly known as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, was an eminent Indian scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India, and passed away on July 27, 2015.

                Kalam was a remarkable aerospace engineer and played a pivotal role in India's civilian space program and military missile development efforts. He was widely referred to as the "Missile Man of India" for his contributions to the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. Kalam played a crucial role in the development of India's first indigenous satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III) and ballistic missiles such as the Agni and Prithvi.
